# Car Price Prediction Web Application
This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the resale value of cars based on various features. Built using Python and Streamlit, the app offers a user-friendly interface for car owners, buyers, and dealers to estimate the fair market value of vehicles.

# Features
Input Parameters: Users can input key details about the car, including:
Car name and manufacturing year
Mileage, engine capacity, and seating capacity
Fuel type, seller type, and transmission mode
Ownership history and kilometers driven
Machine Learning Model:
A pre-trained model (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) analyzes these inputs to predict the car's price.
The model uses a dataset of historical car prices for training.
Technologies Used
Backend:
Machine Learning: Python (libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
Data Handling: pickle for model serialization
Frontend:
Web Framework: Streamlit for creating the interactive interface
Hosting:
Local deployment with options to publish publicly on platforms like Streamlit Cloud.
Objective
The app aims to:

Assist users in estimating car prices quickly and accurately.
Simplify the decision-making process for buyers and sellers in the used car market.
